#  LogStoreDevelopment

A simple app to facilitate development of the Log Store package to make log output accessible from within an iOS app.

Based on Chapter 1. Debugging on the Go, of Build Location-Based Projects for iOS, by Dominik Hauser.


### Usage: 
The app generates  a couple log entries at startup.  To view the log knock the left side of your phone (display up) against your left palm.  The log will pop up in a modal view.  Dismiss it by dragging down from the top.

The log is stored in the iOS file area of the app.  Currently there is no way to clear the log file other than deleting or replacing the app.
